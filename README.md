[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-ts-package-eslint-github-actions.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-ts-package-eslint-github-actions) [![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)

## Overview

This is a template repository scaffolded using `create-react-library -t typescript` with added Github Actions workflows for build, test, release cycle of CI/CD pipelines.

**Linting** conformity is provided by `eslint` and `prettier` customized and extended with better typescript support. Rulesets are designed for modern `es2020`, for VS Code developers, be sure to install both [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) and [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) plugins from the marketplace to enable auto format and inline rule warnings.

**Local build, run, test** configurations are included for `.vscode` using `launch.json` options for `yarn:start` events.

Packages are designed for development as **UI components** and contain base theme layout support for [@chakra-ui/react](). This behavior can be easily customized in your fork by removing related packages and [theme](theme/) folder.
